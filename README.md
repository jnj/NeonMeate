# Overview #
NeonMeate is a GTK3 MPD client.

## Features ##
 * Large display of album artwork
 * Background color gradient that compliments the album art
 * Works alongside other MPD clients; for example, ncmpcpp can be used to manage what's playing while this displays album art.

This is a work in progress.
