# Overview #
NeonMeate is a GTK3 MPD (https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD) client. The name is a reference
to the Captain Beefheart song _Neon Meate Dream of a Octafish_.


## Features ##
 * Large display of album artwork
 * Background color gradient that complements the album art
 * Works alongside other MPD clients; for example, ncmpcpp can be used to manage what's playing while this displays album art.

This is a work in progress.
